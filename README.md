# What is it.

A custom keyboard layout for Windows (only tried on Win 10), based on the standard US International layout that adds improved support for diacritics ("accents on letters, like German umlaute äüö"). I was dissatisfied with the standard layout having the quotes, (", ') as a dead key and have removed this. The key is now mapped as a regular key.

# Who needs it.

I'm a native German speaker working in an multinational comapany working in IT. I work on Windows, Linux and Mac. I need a layout that supports both German diacritics as well as easy single quotes for english abbreviations (e.g. "It's"). Furthermore, I write software even now and then, even if I'm no full-time dev. Therefore, I need easy symbols without modifiers ([]/\|{}). This layout optimises for all those requirements.

Furthermore, I use Colemak, which works really neatly with this layout. On top, I've mapped the AltGr+[QPY] to work with tap-dances on my Keychron QMK-enabled keyboard. This way, I don't have to use any mod keys to type German. *Hint*: ß is not mapped via tap-dance, because the double S key sequence is a quite frequent one and I don't want to have to pace my key strikes to prevent tapping a ß.
# How it works.

## Access to Diacritics

- AltGr+[QPY] gives me my German umlauts with support for capitalisation
- AltGr+S gives me ß
- other diacritics are also easily accessible, if not needed by me personally

## Install

Simply run the installer.
